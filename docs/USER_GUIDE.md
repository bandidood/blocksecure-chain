## Contract Scanning

### Scanning a Deployed Contract

1. **Enter Contract Address**
   ```
   Example: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
   ```

2. **Click "Scan"**
   - The platform will check the on-chain SecurityOracle
   - Results typically appear within 2-5 seconds

3. **View Results**
   - Safety status (SAFE/UNSAFE)
   - Total vulnerabilities count
   - Breakdown by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### Understanding Scan Results

#### Safety Badge
- **âœ“ SAFE**: No critical or high vulnerabilities found
- **âœ— UNSAFE**: Critical or high vulnerabilities detected

#### Vulnerability Counts
- **Critical**: Immediate security threats requiring urgent action
- **High**: Significant vulnerabilities that should be fixed soon
- **Medium**: Moderate issues that need attention
- **Low**: Minor issues or informational findings

## Understanding Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability Types

#### 1. **Reentrancy** (CRITICAL)
**What it is**: A contract calls an external contract before updating its state, allowing the external contract to call back and potentially drain funds.

**Example Impact**: The DAO hack (2016) - $60M stolen

**How to Fix**:
- Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Implement ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin
- Update state before external calls

#### 2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow** (HIGH)
**What it is**: Arithmetic operations that exceed the maximum or minimum value for a data type.

**Example Impact**: BeautyChain (2018) - $900M token value manipulation

**How to Fix**:
- Use Solidity 0.8.0+ (built-in overflow checks)
- Use SafeMath library for older versions
- Add explicit bounds checking

#### 3. **Access Control** (HIGH)
**What it is**: Missing or improper access restrictions allowing unauthorized users to call sensitive functions.

**Example Impact**: Parity Wallet (2017) - $150M locked

**How to Fix**:
- Implement role-based access control
- Use OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
- Add proper modifiers to sensitive functions

#### 4. **Front-Running** (MEDIUM)
**What it is**: Malicious actors observe pending transactions and submit their own with higher gas to execute first.

**Example Impact**: Price manipulation in DEXs

**How to Fix**:
- Use commit-reveal schemes
- Implement private mempool solutions
- Add transaction ordering protections

#### 5. **Timestamp Dependency** (MEDIUM)
**What it is**: Relying on block.timestamp for critical logic, which miners can manipulate slightly.

**Example Impact**: Game results manipulation

**How to Fix**:
- Use block.number instead when possible
- Accept 15-second variance in logic
- Use oracles for precise time requirements

#### 6. **Unchecked Call** (MEDIUM)
**What it is**: Not checking return values from low-level calls, leading to silent failures.

**Example Impact**: Silent fund loss

**How to Fix**:
```solidity
// Bad
address.call{value: amount}("");

// Good
(bool success, ) = address.call{value: amount}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed");
```

#### 7. **Delegatecall** (HIGH)
**What it is**: Using delegatecall with user-controlled addresses, allowing arbitrary code execution in your contract's context.

**Example Impact**: Parity Wallet library destruction

**How to Fix**:
- Avoid delegatecall when possible
- Never use with user-controlled addresses
- Implement strict whitelisting

#### 8. **tx.origin** (MEDIUM)
**What it is**: Using tx.origin for authorization instead of msg.sender, vulnerable to phishing.

**Example Impact**: Unauthorized fund transfers

**How to Fix**:
```solidity
// Bad
require(tx.origin == owner);

// Good
require(msg.sender == owner);
```

### Severity Levels Explained

| Severity | Description | Action Timeline |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Exploitable vulnerability causing direct fund loss | Immediate (< 24 hours) |
| **HIGH** | Major security issue requiring quick resolution | Within 7 days |
| **MEDIUM** | Moderate risk requiring planned fix | Within 30 days |
| **LOW** | Minor issue or optimization opportunity | Next development cycle |
| **INFORMATIONAL** | Best practice recommendations | Optional |

## On-Chain Integration

### SecurityOracle Contract

All scan results are stored on-chain in the SecurityOracle contract, providing:
- Transparent vulnerability tracking
- Immutable audit records
- Community-driven security intelligence

### Contract Blacklist

Contracts with critical vulnerabilities are automatically blacklisted:
- Prevents integration with unsafe contracts
- Protects users from known vulnerabilities
- Can be whitelisted after fixes are verified

### Audit Reports

View comprehensive audit reports including:
- Total vulnerability count
- Breakdown by severity
- Security score
- Auditor information
- Timestamp

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Scan Early and Often**
   - Run scans during development
   - Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
   - Scan before each deployment

2. **Fix by Priority**
   - Address critical vulnerabilities immediately
   - Plan fixes for high/medium severity issues
   - Document low-severity items for future updates

3. **Verify Fixes**
   - Re-scan after implementing fixes
   - Run comprehensive tests
   - Consider professional audit for critical contracts

4. **Stay Updated**
   - Monitor new vulnerability patterns
   - Update dependencies regularly
   - Follow security best practices

### For Auditors

1. **Use Multiple Tools**
   - Combine automated scanning with manual review
   - Cross-reference findings
   - Verify all critical findings

2. **Document Thoroughly**
   - Provide clear descriptions
   - Include proof-of-concept when possible
   - Suggest specific fixes

3. **Follow Up**
   - Verify fixes are implemented correctly
   - Re-scan after changes
   - Update on-chain records

### For Users

1. **Check Before Interacting**
   - Scan contracts before sending funds
   - Look for recent audit reports
   - Check blacklist status

2. **Understand Risks**
   - No tool catches everything
   - Professional audits are recommended for high-value contracts
   - New vulnerabilities are discovered regularly

3. **Report Issues**
   - Use the platform to report vulnerabilities
   - Help protect the community
   - Follow responsible disclosure

## Integration Guide

### API Usage

Access vulnerability data programmatically:

```javascript
// Check contract safety
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.blocksecure.chain/api/contracts/0x.../safe'
);
const data = await response.json();

if (data.data.isSafe) {
  // Safe to interact
} else {
  // Show warning to user
}
```

### Smart Contract Integration

```solidity
interface ISecurityOracle {
    function isContractSafe(address _contract) external view returns (bool);
}

contract MyDApp {
    ISecurityOracle oracle = ISecurityOracle(0x...);
    
    function safeInteraction(address target) external {
        require(oracle.isContractSafe(target), "Unsafe contract");
        // Proceed with interaction
    }
}
```

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is BlockSecure Chain free to use?**  
A: Yes, the basic scanning features are free. Advanced features may require a subscription.

**Q: Which networks are supported?**  
A: Ethereum, Polygon, Polygon Mumbai (testnet), and Sepolia (testnet). More networks coming soon.

**Q: How accurate are the scans?**  
A: Our analyzer uses industry-standard tools (Slither, Mythril) with high accuracy. However, no automated tool is 100% accurate. Professional audits are recommended for critical contracts.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What languages are supported?**  
A: Currently only Solidity. Support for Vyper coming soon.

**Q: Can I scan private contracts?**  
A: Yes, through our API. Contact us for private scanning options.

**Q: How long are scan results stored?**  
A: On-chain records are permanent. Off-chain data is retained according to our data policy.

**Q: Can I integrate BlockSecure into my dApp?**  
A: Yes! Use our API or directly interact with the SecurityOracle contract.

### Security Questions

**Q: Is my contract code stored?**  
A: We only store vulnerability metadata on-chain, not your contract source code.

**Q: Who can report vulnerabilities?**  
A: Anyone can report vulnerabilities. Verification requires REPORTER_ROLE.

**Q: What happens if my contract is blacklisted?**  
A: Fix the vulnerabilities and request a re-scan. Admins can whitelist after verification.
